This repository demonstrates a common Javascript bug caused by type coercion with the + operator. When adding a number and a string, Javascript implicitly converts the number to a string, resulting in string concatenation instead of numerical addition.  The solution showcases how to use the Number() function to explicitly convert the string to a number before the addition operation, resulting in the correct numerical sum.
